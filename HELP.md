##Pronoun: Đại từ nhân xưng
A pronoun is a word that is used instead(thay thế) of a noun or noun phrase. 
Pronouns refer(đề cập) to either a noun that has already been mentioned or to a noun that does not need to named 
specifically.

Personal pronouns, which refer to the person or people speaking or writing(first person), the person or people being 
spoken(second person), or other people or things(third person). Like nouns, personal pronouns can function as either the
subject of a verb or the object of a verb or preposition: "She likes him, but he loves her".

*As subject*:    singular    

        _ 1St:    I            we 

        _ 2st:    you          you

        _ 3st:   he,she,it    they

        - 1st:      me          us
