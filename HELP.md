## What is pronoun
A pronoun is a word that is used instead(thay thế) of a noun or noun phrase.

specifically.

Personal pronouns, which refer to the person or people speaking or writing(first person), the person or people being 
spoken(second person), or other people or things(third person). Like nouns, personal pronouns can function as either the
subject of a verb or the object of a verb or preposition: "She likes him, but he loves her".
